The Duplicate-Questions-Pair-Detection project is designed to identify whether two questions are semantically equivalent, with a primary focus on improving customer service operations. This system leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect duplicate or similar queries, reducing redundant responses and improving response times.

Key Features:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses state-of-the-art NLP algorithms to understand the meaning behind questions and identify duplicate queries, even if they are phrased differently.

Machine Learning Model: Trained on a robust dataset, the model effectively determines whether two questions are similar, ensuring accuracy in duplicate detection.

Improved Customer Service Efficiency: By detecting duplicate questions, the system allows customer service teams to streamline their responses, reducing time spent on repetitive inquiries and enhancing the overall customer experience.

Customizable for Various Industries: The solution can be tailored to fit a wide range of customer service environments, from tech support to e-commerce, by adapting the detection model to domain-specific questions.

Impact:

This project enhances customer support efficiency by automating the identification of repeated queries, ensuring faster and more accurate responses, ultimately improving customer satisfaction.
